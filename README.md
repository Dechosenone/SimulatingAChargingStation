# SimulatingAChargingStation
After analyzing different parameters, simulations for charging stations are implemented, and electrical vehicles. Several parameters define during the report, but the total idea is focusing on two types of arrival:
1. Customers in need of EVs come to the station periodically to pick up charged EVs and need to serve immediately.
2. Arriving EVs join the charging queue, they have low charge rate or fully discharge, they wait a maximum time before leaving to look for another station.
